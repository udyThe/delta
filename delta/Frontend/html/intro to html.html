    <h1>Yo wassup world todays my birthday</h1>
    <ul>
        <h2> Want to buy</h2>
        <li>bread</li>
        <li>jam</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>cake</li>

    </ul>

    <ol type="a">
        <h2>This is ordered list</h2>
        <li>take water</li>
        <li>add milk powder</li>
        <li>stir it </li>
        <li>milk is ready</li>

    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>is this we can define the type of numbering in attributes</p>

    <h2>anchor element</h2>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">google</a>
    <p>absolute tag and relative links ...absolute links is those which are we get from internet....and relative links 
    are those which we store files on computer and fetch it from there</p>




        
    <h2>image element</h2>

    <p>the format to use image tag is .... < img src="" alt ="" height="" width=""> <br> where we put link or file path in the 'src' and
    alternate name to be displayed instead of the image when internet of broken or the file is corrupted in some way in <b>'alt</b> and 
    height and width accordingly of the image </p>
    
    <img src ='im.webp' alt = 'ironman image' height="400">
    <p>this was the example of image element within cocmputer ...now we will see how to link image through link of internet</p>
    
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/2e/a1/6a2ea1039b9100aad4d47dacca5a8654.webp" alt="captain america" height="400">
    <p>so this image will also be deleted from here when the owner of this image delets this from the internet</p>


    <h4> now comes some more tags</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>line break 'br'</b></li>
        <p>this is used to move the cursor to the next line, for example: <br>'twinkle twinkle litter star how i wonder 
            what you are'this is a line</p>
        <p> and we want ot write this sentence in different lines so we just put 'br' tag at the end wherever we want to break the line </p>
        <p>now we see it as:<br>twinkle twinkle litter star<br> how i winder<br>what you are</p><br><br>

        <li>bold tag 'u'</li>
        <li>italic tag 'i'</li>
        <li>underline tab 'u'</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>comment tag   '< !--' </b></li>
        <p>this is a comment tag in html and is not executed. <br> we can comment out any part
             in html by <b>selecting the part and pressing ' ctrl+ / ' (control + forward slash)</b></p>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p>#attributes are like.....< ol type="i"> so it makes a list in roman....<b>so this 'type' is called an attribute</b></p>
