    <h1 style="text-transform: capitalize; text-align: center;"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">css</span> part
        2</h1>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3 style="text-transform: capitalize;">Selectors in css</h3>
    <p>selectors like 'h' we use selectors in css to select those on which we want to apply style on <br>
        there is a universal with wich we can select everything that is - astirisk '*' <br>
        <b>1. element selectors </b> are those selectors which we were using till now like 'h' which selects all
        headings <br>
        <b>2. id selectors</b> - as we assign id to components in html we can select them ...they cannt start with numbers...they may contain but cannnot start wiht numver<b>using id by - #-id- </b>
        <br>
        <b>3. class selectors</b> - we can define class name in inline style in html with the elemect we wanna group as
        class
        ....just assign class in the elect 'h' or whatever <br>
        <b>4. decendant selectors</b> - they are like parent child relation.....like div < p then it will only select
            those paragraph with div in them</p>

            <h3 style="text-transform: capitalize;">sibling combinator</h3>
            <p>if 'h3 + p' is written then only those paragraph will be selected which are writtedn just after h3
                headings <br>
                here '+' is the combinator</p>

            <h3>child combinator</h3>
            <p>if 'span > button' is written that means it will select buttons only which are directly after the span
                ...unlike
                decendent selectors which can skip any number of element <br> here '>' is the combinator</p>

            <h3>attribute selector</h3>
            <p>in this type we can just give the attribute of any and apply the property...example
                <br><br>input[type="text"]{ <br> } <br> <br>
                here giving property in square braces in necessary (no spaces between in input and square braces)
            </p>


            <h2>psudo class</h2>
            <p>a keyword that specifies the special state of the selected element <br>some types are mentioned <br>1.
                hover <br>2. active <br>
                3. checked <br> 4. nth-of-type</p>
            <p>to define a psudo class we use .... colon (:) after the specofoed element</p>

            <h3>1. hover</h3>
            <p>it is a style which is applied to the the element when hovered by mouse cursor <br>but in the
                case in css when some property is already defined using # or id ....then this does not take effect
                ....its like priority</p>


            <h3>2. active</h3>
            <p>it is a style which is applied when a element is clicked on ... <b> not hovered</b></p>
            <h3>3. checked</h3>

            <h3>4. nth-of-type</h3>
            <p> for example: like if we want to color every odd number from a list to yellow....we use nth-of-type <br>
                <br>
                div:nth-of-type(2n){ <br>
                background-color: blanchedalmond; <br>
                } <br> <br>
                so the 'n' here works as repeation ...it counts to 2 and then starts again counting from 1
            </p>

            <h2>psudo element</h2>
            <p>we use double colon :: like this...single colon would also work but we will use 2</p>
            <p>some types are <br>1. first letter <br>2.first line <br>3. selection <br> <br> <b>example</b> <br><br>
                h1::first-letter{ <br>
                color: green;<br>
                } <br>
            </p>

            <h2>cascading and specificity</h2>
            <p>specificity is the priority given to the property declared in the css file <br> 1. id> (class= attribute=
                psudo-class..that hover and all)
                > (element = psudo-element...that first letter and line thing) <br> 2. more selectors is better than
                less selectors
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>more selectors> less selectors</b> <br> 3. if specificity is
                same then cascading <br>
                is checked...basicallly it means whichever comes last, that property will be applied <br>
                &#x2022; <b>if multiple files of css is atteched to html file...then then the contradicting property
                    will be applied of the css file which was attached at the end </b>
            </p>
            <h3>inline specificity</h3>
            <p>what if what if the style of element is already defined in the html, then it would give the highest
                priority and it can not changed...though inline css in not recommended</p>

            <h2>!important</h2>
            <p>this is the highest priority for css properties...where ever this is assigned ...it is absolute ...it
                have more priority then inline itsel.but this is not ususally used</p>
            <p>!important is put after the property and then the semi colon is put</p>

            <h2>inheritance</h2>
            <p>in this ...the properties is inherited by the child elements by their parents properties... <br>for
                example if i define a color for div then the elements will also have the properties of div. <br><b>but
                    in some case its dosent work like that</b> some elements like input or buttons does not inherit
                properties from anybody...we have to assign seperatly in css by typing <br> ' color: inherit; ' <br>
                then they will inherit</p>
            <p>&#x2022; some properties can not be inherited like width, height, border...etc in this case we have to
                set the property individually</p>
