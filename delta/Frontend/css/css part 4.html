<body style="background-color: rgb(215, 193, 235);">
    <h2>Alpha and Opacity</h2>
    <p>till now we have learnt about rbg colors but if we wanna give lightness or in other words make the colors
        translucent we could use 'alpha' to make it happen... the value varies from 0 to 1.... use 'rgba' for setting
        colors
    </p>
    <p>for setting opacity ...use the term 'opacity' and the value varies from 0 to 1 .... the difference between the
        using alpha and opacity is that alpha decreases the visibility of only color it is set to ...but the opacity
        element just chages the visibility of the whole elements included in the portion...like is div is set with
        opacity then the whole div will be getting changes in the visibility </p>

    <h2>CSS transition </h2>
    <p>this is used to create transitions in htmk ...use transition: 1s...and then define the property change in
        different section</p>
    <h2>CSS transform</h2>
    <p>this is used to rotate, scale, skew and translate (skew= tilt, translate = move in X and Y) <br> the value of
        scale vavries from 0 to 1... and is used to make it bog or small <br>translate on other hand moves it in x and y
        direction</p>
    <h2>box shadow</h2>
    <p>it adds shadow to the element frame
        <br> the format is ... box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px green; ... here the fisrt and second size shows the distance of
        shadow from the element in x offset and y offset and the thind size shows the blur radius and the color show the color of shadow
    </p>
    <h2>background image</h2>
    <p>we can set imaga as background too just set the url in it ...ex background-image: url(blah blah blah)</p>
    <h2>card hover effect</h2>
    <p> just an hover effect on a div which have box shadow changed</p>

    <h2>position property</h2>
    <p>4 types <br>1.static <br>2. relative <br>3.absolute <br>4.fixed</p>
    
    <h3><b>static</b></h3>
    <p>-static means default value ...no meaning of left right top or bottom offset (shifting from left/rifght to the desired location) <br> ex <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position: static;</p>

    <h3><b>relative</b></h3>
    <p>the offset is relative to itself based in the values if top right bottom and left ...like its shifted in respective of itself instead of the webpage <br> ex
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position: relative <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top: 100px; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bottom: 100px; </p>
    <h3><b>absolute</b></h3>
    <p>in this the position is set with respective with the page not with anything , but if the parent class defined then the property is inherited..... if not then it will be positioned respected to the page <br> ex <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position: absolute; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top: 200px;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bottom:200px;</p> 
    <h3><b>fixed</b></h3>
