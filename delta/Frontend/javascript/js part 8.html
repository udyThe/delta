    <h2>array methods</h2>
    <h3>for each</h3>
    <p>arr.foreach(function)</p>
    <h3>map</h3>
    <p>arr.map(function) .....basically it acts of every element of the array</p>
    <h3>filter</h3>
    <p>arr.filter(function).......its like a filter as it states returns array of those elements from the given array which passes the filter condition</p>
    <h3>every </h3>
    <p>acts as "and" gate for every element, retuns true is all is true, one flase means flase</p>
    <h3>reduce method</h3>
    <p>this reduces to one value (returns one single value) </p>
    <p>example <br> [1,2,3,4].reduce( (res,el)=> (res+el) ) <br> here the operation is performed on every element and then on the last iteration the value is returned of the 'el'</p>
    <h3>spread method</h3>
    <p>this spreads every element of the iterable into sperate stuff this is done by three dots ....eg math.min(...arr)</p>
